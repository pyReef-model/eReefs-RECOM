    "We will investigate the relationship between the strength of the wind and the direction of the surface currents for two locations. We will look at **Myrmidon Reef**, which is on the far outer edge of the GBR and is almost right in the middle of the southern **Eastern Australian Current**. \n",

    "The East Australian Current (EAC) usually is a strong southward current near Myrmidon and Davies Reefs. During winter months the wind moves in a north eastern direction in the near opposite direction to the EAC. When the wind is low the surface currents are dominated by the EAC. As the wind picks up at some speed the wind overpowers the EAC and the surface current moves in the direction of the wind.\n",

    "To determine the relation between the wind and the surface currents we will pull out hourly time series wind and current data for our two locations of interest. We will then look at the correlation between the wind and current vectors, where a correlation of 1 indicates they are pointing in the same direction, and -1 indicated they are in opposite directions. \n",

That is each observation is in one row per time step, variable, depth and site. For each of these combinations there are summary statistics corresponding to the aggregation process that was applied. Somewhat confusingly we extracted hourly data from the hourly eReefs hydrodynamic model and so there was no aggregation applied. As a result all the stats values are the same and the mean corresponds to the actual extracted data values. Let's clean this up a little by removing the redundant columns. Here we also drop the depth variable as the depth of the wind doesn't match the depth of the surface current and so makes it difficult to align the wind and the current together. Since we are only processing a single depth this is an OK simplification. If we were processing the current at multiple depths then we would need a more complex set of data wraggling."
